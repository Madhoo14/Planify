          Planify is based on the concept of Bullet Journaling, also called as,
          BuJo in the Bullet Journaling world. It is a proven fact that goals
          that are written down and goals that a have an action plan are the
          goals that are realized. This app helps you identify SMART goals,
          break them into smaller chunks and plan your day so that you move
          towards your goal on a daily basis. I highly encourage you to not
          clutter your Todo list with too many items. Always delegate what you
          can and don't add things that do not take your forward towards your
          goal. Respect the Todo list.
