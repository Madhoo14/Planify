          Planify is based on the concept of Bullet Journaling also called as
          BuJo in the Bullet Journaling world. It is a proven fact that goals
          that are written down somewhere and goals that a have an action plan
          are the goals that are realized. This app helps you with identifying
          SMART goals and break up your goals into smaller chunks and plan your
          day so that you move towards your goal on a daily basis. I highly
          encourage you to not clutter your Todo list with too many items.
          Always delegate what you can and don't add things that do not take
          your forward towards your goal. Respect the Todo list.
